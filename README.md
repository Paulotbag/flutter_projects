# Description of each week work
Week 3:
In Week 3, the project is about using layouts in Flutter by recreating a complex page layout with a Column widget containing multiple Rows of text and images. The activity involved aligning text and stacking images with text overlays to match a given design, reinforcing your understanding of Flutter's layout system.

Week 4:
Week 4 activity focused on implementing AlertDialog, Snackbar, and EncryptedSharedPreferences in Flutter app. I added functionality to the login page to save and retrieve login credentials, showing alerts for user confirmation and snackbars for feedback, enhancing app's interactivity and security.

Week 5:
In Week 5, I created a second page for my app called ProfilePage, navigating to it upon successful login. I added four TextFields for user details, along with buttons for calling, messaging, and emailing. This lab strengthened my skills in multi-page app navigation and user data handling using the repository pattern.

Week 6:
Week 6 introduces the creation of a "To Do" list application. I implemented a ListView where users could add and delete items through a text field and long-press gesture. This activity enhanced my understanding of list management and user interaction in Flutter.

Week 7:
In Week 7, I extended the "To Do" list application by integrating database functionality. Items added to the list were stored in a database, and upon restarting the app, the list was repopulated from the database. This work emphasized the importance of persistent data storage in mobile applications.

Week 8:
Week 8 focused on responsive layouts. I modified the "To Do" list application to show item details on a separate page or pane, depending on the device's orientation. This work reinforced my understanding of responsive design, ensuring that my app provides an optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
